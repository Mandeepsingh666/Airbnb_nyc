## Overview
This is a simple project, in which I conducted **Exploratory Data analysis** ( EDA ) and also tried to predict the price of a room or private house. I used the **Scikit-learn** library for machine learning  and **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Matplotli**b and **Seaborn** for EDA. The model was trained on various features such as neighbourhood(location), Number of reviews, host ID etc .


### Motivation 
What could be a perfect way to utilize an unfortunate lockdown period? Like most of us,   I spent my time learning python , listening to podcasts and learning Machine learning. I part-time worked as an uber driver when I was going to school. I hear passengers talking about Airbnb and how it is better than a hotel. It made me curious to know more about the business and learn how hosts decide what price to charge.  

### Technical Aspects 
 1. In first part, I conducted the **EDA** and then fill the **missing data**
 2. In second part, I selected the important features for **Machine Learning models**
